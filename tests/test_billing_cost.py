"""Tests for BillingSummary.total_cost — the per-period charge derivation.

Regression coverage for the Burlington Hydro feed, whose UsageSummary detail list carries
running-balance bookkeeping ("Balance Forward" / "Payments Received") and subtotal lines
("New Charges This Period" / "Total Amount Due") alongside the real charges. Two failure modes
seen in real data, both fixed by summing only the itemized charge lines:

  - Naively summing *every* detail triple-counts the bill (charges + New-Charges subtotal +
    Total-Amount-Due subtotal) — the first ~3× inflation we saw.
  - On roughly every other bill the "New Charges This Period" / "Total Amount Due" subtotals
    are themselves *corrupt* (stamped well above the itemized charges), so trusting them is
    also wrong — the second inflation. Only the itemized lines are reliable.

# ignored the per-line multiplier and divided billLastPeriod by 100,000, yielding $1.72 for the
